We do not limit the amount of storage and bandwidth your site can use as long as it complies with our Hosting Agreement. Should your website bandwidth or storage usage present a risk to the stability, performance or uptime of our servers, we will notify you via email and you may be required to upgrade to a Virtual Private Server or Dedicated (Private) Server, or we may restrict the resources your website is using. Itâ€™s very rare that a website violates our Hosting Agreement and is typically only seen in sites that use hosting for file sharing or storage.'></span></strong></div>
