The best eCommerce website design draws users in and encourages them to complete a purchase. A smart design does more than just make your company look good; it features trust signals that help put first-time visitors at ease. Trust signals are features on your website that inspire consumers to believe in the safety and security of your site for making online purchases. For instance, having testimonials and customer reviews helps new users feel more comfortable purchasing from a website.<br /><br />

Another trust signal that's part of some of the best eCommerce shopping carts is payment assurance. Consumers need to know that their payment information will be safe on your site. Third-party badges—from PayPal<sup>&reg;</sup>, VeriSign<sup>&reg;</sup>, and Visa<sup>&reg;</sup>, just to name a few—help first-time visitors feel more confident and more willing to make transactions.<br /><br />

In addition to including customer reviews and third-party badges, you should also make it easy for visitors to contact you. Being transparent about your company's location and phone number, as well as how visitors can reach you (through phone, email, social media, etc.), helps consumers feel more confident about doing business through your website.<br /><br />

Boost customers' trust in your site by seamlessly integrating your social media presence with your website, allowing users to share your content, follow your business, or provide feedback.<br /><br />

If you're a current GoDaddy customer, just follow the below steps to turn on your site's social media features:<br /><br />

<ol>
  <li>Login to your <a href="[@T[link:<external parammode='explicit' linktype='MYAURL' secure='true' path='/'><param name='ci' value='95146' /></external>]@T]">Account Manager</a>.</li>
  <li>Under <b>Products</b> list, click <b>Online Store</b> then click <b>Launch</b> next to the appropriate account.</li>
  <li>On the <b>Promote</b> tab, click <b>Promote</b>.</li>
  <li>Select <b>Turn On</b> for each of the features you want to activate (Some features cannot be turned on until you publish your Online Store by clicking the <b>Go Live</b> link).</li>
</ol>
