Website templates help individuals and business owners create an online presence without having to hire a web developer or webmaster. In other words, using a site template puts you — the website owner — in control. Templates provide a great option for people who are willing to spend some time getting their website online, but are not willing to shell out the thousands of dollars that a web developer might charge.<br /><br />

<b>Two Basic Options – Free or Paid</b><br />
If you've decided to use a web template to create your site, you'll find a lot of options to choose from. Your first decision will be related to your pocketbook. Are you willing to pay a (typically) small price for a website design or are you looking for completely free website templates? Each option comes with its own pros and cons.<br /><br />

<b>Free Website Templates</b><br />
Obviously, the main benefit of a free website template is the cost. You spend no money upfront. However, these web templates typically have more limitations than ones that might cost a small fee.<br /><br />

Free web templates are often harder to customize and often lack certain functionalities, such as online shopping carts. While these factors may not be a drawback for a personal website, it's not ideal for a business owner who wants to create a strong, branded image online or needs to sell products through their website.<br /><br />

On a similar note, free templates often look just like that — a free template. They lack the polished look of a professional design. Once again, this might be fine for some websites, but business owners will probably want to consider something else when establishing their company's online presence.<br /><br />

<b>Website Templates for a Fee</b><br />
If you decide to pay for your web template, you'll find that some places will sell them for a one-time, upfront fee, while others will charge you a small monthly fee.<br /><br />

Places that require a monthly fee typically give you access to a customer support team — a great benefit if you ever run into a problem or just want some help setting up your website.<br /><br />

Most paid templates provide you with designs that can easily be customized to reflect your style or brand, helping you to create a website you can be proud of.<br /><br />

<b>Which One?</b><br />
If price is your driving factor, going with a free website template might make the most sense for you.<br /><br />

If you want to create a professional-looking website, but can't afford to pay a high-end developer, you'll want to shell out a little bit of money for a paid website template and site building tool. A website builder platform will make customizing your site easier than a free template, which makes it a smart investment for many website owners.<br /><br />
