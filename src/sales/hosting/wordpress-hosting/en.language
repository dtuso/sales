What is WordPress?
<phrase key="35561-faq-1-answer-1" />
WordPress<sup>&reg;</sup> is a blog- and Web-publishing platform that's not only easy to use, but recognized the world over as a standard in website creation. With its focus on aesthetics, Web standards and usability, WordPress is an open-source platform that lets you manage everything from a small personal blog to a large commercial site with hundreds of pages. Hundreds of thousands of sites trust their online presence to WordPress – and with Managed WordPress Hosting from [@T[companyname:name]@T], you can too.

How does your version of WordPress differ from other installations?
<phrase key="35561-faq-3-answer-1" />
It doesn't. We start you out with the latest version of WordPress, the same one you’d download from WordPress.org. And anytime there’s an update, we install it for you automatically.

<phrase key="35561-faq-4-question" />
Do I need to set up my database?

<phrase key="35561-faq-5-question" />
If I have a WordPress site hosted somewhere else, can I move it to [@T[companyname:name]@T]?
<phrase key="35561-faq-5-answer-1" />
Yes. You can migrate your site over to [@T[companyname:name]@T] Managed WordPress in just one click. Either move it to your domain name or put it on a temporary domain, then just do a quick review and you’re ready to publish.
