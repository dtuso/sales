What are Virtual Private Servers?
<phrase key="FaqQuestion11Text" />
A <strong>virtual private server</strong>, also known as VPS or a virtual dedicated server, is an affordable way to get advanced hosting performance and control when a traditional shared hosting plan is not powerful enough to handle your traffic. Unlike a shared hosting account, a virtual private server lets you install custom programs and provides you a guaranteed port connection of 10 megabits per second. 
<strong>VPS hosting</strong> takes the hassle out of using a dedicated server without losing configurability. We make it easy for you to get started with six different pre-configured plans to choose from. 
For more information, see our <a href="javascript:atl_PopUp('[@T[link:<external linktype='communityurl' path='help/category/60/' secure='false'><param name='isc' value='gtnila43' /><param name='ci' value='90964' /></external>]@T]','display2','left=20,top=20,scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes,width=800,height=700');" >Virtual Dedicated Linux</a> and <a href="javascript:atl_PopUp('[@T[link:<external linktype='communityurl' path='help/category/202/' secure='false'><param name='isc' value='gtnila43' /><param name='ci' value='90966' /></external>]@T]','display2','left=20,top=20,scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes,width=800,height=700');" >Virtual Dedicated Windows</a> product support pages.
<phrase key="FaqQuestion12" />
How does a Virtual Private Server differ from a Dedicated Server?
<phrase key="FaqQuestion12Text" />
While a dedicated server is exactly as it sounds â an entire server dedicated specifically to your site â a virtual private server is partitioned in a way that it isolates your site from others on the same virtual server. This lets you have administrator (root) access, greater resources, a dedicated IP address and other features that would normally only be available with a dedicated server.
We segment these servers in a way that each <strong>VPS</strong> operates almost independently from the other segmented accounts on the box. This way, you can count on a consistent, high performing experience even when usage spikes on the primary server.
<phrase key="FaqQuestion13" />
Who should use a Virtual Private Server?
<phrase key="FaqQuestion13Text" />
Virtual dedicated hosting can be used for a wide variety of purposes. With VPS, you have admin access to install and run virtually anything you want on the server.
Virtual private servers are useful to businesses and individuals that run websites that generate a lot of traffic. Sites running complex applications requiring large amounts of bandwidth would benefit from VPS hosting. Our <strong>virtual servers</strong> feature high performance with large amounts of disk space and bandwidth.
<phrase key="FaqQuestion14" />
Are [@T[companyname:name]@T] Virtual Private Servers configurable?
<phrase key="FaqQuestion14Text" />
You bet! Having this feature allows you to change as your site grows. In fact, most upgrades can be done through your account under the My Products section.

<phrase key="FaqQuestion15" />

<phrase key="FaqQuestion16" />
How do I manage my Virtual Private Server?
<phrase key="FaqQuestion16Text" />
You can access your VPS using the Hosting Control Center. Simply log in to your [@T[companyname:name]@T] account, and then click on Servers. From this menu, you can click Launch next to the VPS server you want to use. 
Using the Virtual Dedicated Hosting Manager, you can perform basic server management including account setup, monitoring bandwidth usage, and scheduling server reboots. You can also submit Trouble Tickets for any problems related to your VPS.
You can also install a control panel on your VPS to manage the more advanced features of your server. 
For more information, see <a href="javascript:atl_PopUp('[@T[link:<external linktype='communityurl' path='help/article/6225/' secure='false'><param name='isc' value='gtnila43' /><param name='ci' value='90962' /></external>]@T]','display2','left=20,top=20,scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes,width=800,height=700');" >Comparing Dedicated Hosting Control Panels</a>.
<phrase key="FaqQuestion17" />
What is Bandwidth Overage Protection?
<phrase key="FaqQuestion17Text" />
Bandwidth Overage Protection guards you from overage charges by automatically suspending your account when you exceed the allowed bandwidth for your plan. To reinstate your server, simply purchase additional bandwidth, or wait until the start of the next billing cycle.
Bandwidth Overage Protection cannot be added to an account when it is already over its allotted bandwidth.
If you donât already have Bandwidth Overage Protection, and an overage occurs, you can suspend your account manually or purchase additional bandwidth to get you through until the next billing cycle.
For more information, see <a href="javascript:atl_PopUp('[@T[link:<external linktype='communityurl' path='help/article/1418/' secure='false'><param name='isc' value='gtnila43' /><param name='ci' value='90961' /></external>]@T]','display2','left=20,top=20,scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes,width=800,height=700');" >How Do I Add Bandwidth Overage Protection to My Account?</a>
