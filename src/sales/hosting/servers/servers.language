What is a server? 
<phrase key="choosing-tag-line" />
Basically, it’s a large, powerful computer that’s connected to a network so it can ‘serve’ files, such as web pages, to multiple users at once. When selecting a server, there are a lot of options to choose from, even within a single plan. Here’s a quick snapshot of our products to help you get up to speed.
<phrase key="choosing-list-1" />
Dedicated Server: Our ultimate server option. Your own dedicated server, with all the performance, control and flexibility you need.
<phrase key="choosing-list-2" />
Managed VPS (Virtual Private Server): A great option for budget-minded businesses. Similar to a Dedicated Server in power and flexibility, but with a little less control and a lower price tag.
<phrase key="choosing-list-3" />
Managed Hosting: Designed for businesses that need the resources of a Dedicated Server, but don’t have the time or technical expertise to manage it.
<phrase key="choosing-list-4" />
Reseller Hosting: Built for web designers, developers or anyone else who wants to use one of our web servers to power their own hosting business.
<phrase key="choosing-list-5" />
Dedicated IP: More of an add-on for smaller hosting plans, a Dedicated IP is exactly as it sounds: An IP address that’s exclusive to you.
