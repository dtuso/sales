How does Web Hosting work?
<phrase key="faq-first-slide-content-cp" />
<p>
Once you purchase a <strong>Web hosting plan</strong>, [@T[companyname:name]@T] stores your site on one of our servers and assigns it a unique DNS. The DNS serves as the address that allows people around the world to find and view your website. This unique address is required in order for people to view your site.
</p>
<p>
By purchasing a website hosting package, you're basically buying space on one of our servers. It’s similar to the space on a computer’s hard drive, but the server allows your website’s files to be accessed from anywhere.
</p>
<p>

What is web hosting?
<phrase key="faq-first-slide-content" />
<p>
<span>Web hosting</span> is what makes your website viewable to people all over the world. <span>Hosting</span> makes it possible for others to view your website over the Internet – without it; you're the only one who would ever see your <span>Web pages</span>.
</p>
<p>
 A <span>website hosting</span> provider stores your site on their server, giving it a unique address (DNS). It is through this address that people anywhere in the world can find, open, and interact with your site.
</p>
<p>
 Simply put, when you buy website hosting, you're buying space on a server. This is not unlike the space on your computer's hard drive – except that now your files can be opened from anywhere.
</p>
<p>
Hosting couldn't be easier at [@T[companyname:name]@T]. You get <span>secure hosting</span> plans with unlimited bandwidth.

What can I use to build my website?
<phrase key="faq-third-slide-content-cp" />
<p>
  You can build your website in several different ways – from hand-coding with HTML to using a website builder program.
</p>
<p>
  If you require a lot of functionality and versatility from your website, you’ll benefit from programs and applications that can help you build your site. Our <strong>Web hosting</strong> plans give you access to free, server-side applications that can be used to develop and customize your website, including popular Content Management System (CMS) applications like WordPress<sup class="supsymbol">&reg;</sup> and Joomla!<sup class="supsymbol">&reg;</sup>.
</p>
<p>
  We try to make building your website as simple as possible. If you prefer to use popular Web design software such as Adobe Dreamweaver<sup class="supsymbol">&reg;</sup>, Microsoft Expression<sup class="supsymbol">&reg;</sup>, and Apple iWeb, you can easily upload your files to your [@T[companyname:name]@T] hosting account.

<p>
 How you <span>build your own website</span> is entirely up to you. In fact, most basic websites can be hand-coded using HTML.
</p>
<p>
  The more functionality and versatility you require from your website, the more you might need to rely on programs and applications to help build your site. Our Linux and Windows <span>Web hosting plans</span> include a number of free server-side applications that you can use when developing and customizing your websites.
</p>
<p>
 We've made it easy to install popular Content Management System (CMS) applications like WordPress<sup class="supsymbol">&reg;</sup> and Joomla!<sup class="supsymbol">&reg;</sup> through the [@T[companyname:name]@T] Hosting Connection<sup class="supsymbol">&reg;</sup> from your Hosting Control Center.

How do I transfer my Web pages to your server?
<phrase key="faq-fourth-slide-content-cp" />
<p>
  If you’ve built your website in a HTML editor, like Dreamweaver or Microsoft Expression Studio, you have to upload your website files via FTP (File Transfer Protocol). We have a built-in FTP File Manager that you can access in our Hosting Control Center.
</p>
<p>
  However, if your files are larger than 20 MB, we recommend using the tool FileZilla, which works with Windows<sup class="supsymbol">&reg;</sup>, Mac<sup class="supsymbol">&reg;</sup>, and Linux<sup class="supsymbol">&reg;</sup> operating systems, or another third-party FTP client.

<p>
 Let's say you've built your own Web page using an HTML editor like Dreamweaver or Microsoft Expression Studio. Before you can view your website on the Internet, you'll need to upload the pages you've created from your computer to our server via FTP (File Transfer Protocol).
</p>
<p>
 You can use our built-in FTP File Manager located inside the Hosting Control Center.
</p>
<p>
 Or, if you have large files to upload (20 MB+), try using FileZilla, a free tool that works with Windows<sup class="supsymbol">&reg;</sup>, Mac<sup class="supsymbol">&reg;</sup>, and Linux<sup class="supsymbol">&reg;</sup> operating systems.
