      <h2>You have better things to do than manage your hosting.</h2>
      <p>Maintaining a website shouldn't mean spending hours optimizing your server and battling security threats. With Managed WordPress, we handle the technical stuff for you - server setup, security, backups, even performance optimization - so you can spend your time designing, managing content and doing what's important to you.</p>

      <h2>The power of WordPress</h2>
      <p>As the world’s most popular website creation tool and content management system (CMS), WordPress makes it easy to create, manage and publish content for your website or blog – all from your Web browser. Assign authors and give them permissions to manage their own content or create their own blog posts. Make changes across your entire site at once, instead of a page at a time. Even add advanced features by simply installing one of 1000s of free plugins. With WordPress, you make the changes you want, when you want them.</p>
