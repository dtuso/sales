<b>As mentioned above, an SSL Certificate encrypts sensitive data that users submit to your site</b> - such as credit card numbers, password and more – so hackers or other online criminals can’t read it. Our certificates are issued in minutes and can be installed to your GoDaddy hosting account with just a few clicks. But where they really shine is with our powerful SHA-2 and 2048-bit encryption, as well as the ability to cover unlimited servers.

We also offer a Driver Signing Certificate, which gives your hardware drivers the same level of protection and is required by Microsoft® for operating systems Vista and later.

You don’t have to be a technical expert to improve your site’s reliability and security through your DNS (Domain Name Servers). While hackers often target a site’s DNS as a way to re-route visitors to their own malicious site, Premium DNS prevents this by placing your site’s DNS on our global network. This not only secures the process for your visitors, but also improves your site’s performance and reliability.
