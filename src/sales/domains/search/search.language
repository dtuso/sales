<phrase key="FaqLine1Text1" />

<phrase key="FaqLine2Text1" />

<phrase key="FaqLine6Title" />
What is Private Registration and why is it needed?
<phrase key="FaqLine6Text1" />
The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) requires that we make the contact information associated with domain names available to the public via the Whois directory. The Whois database is an online repository of information associated with registered domain names. It stores and publicly displays domain name information, such creation and expiration dates, the registrar of record, and its various contacts (registrant, billing, administrative, and technical). <strong>Private domain registration</strong> is a service that hides personal domain name contact information like your name, address, email address, and phone number from the public.
<phrase key="FaqLine6Text2" />
We understand the thought of displaying your personal information to the public is alarming – but we&#39;re here to protect and help you! Our affiliate company, Domains By Proxy&reg;, offers a private registration service that lets you list Domain By Proxy&#39;s contact information in the Whois database instead of your own!
<phrase key="FaqLine6Text3" />
For more information, visit our <a target="_blank" href="[@T[link:<external linktype='communityurl' path='help/article/231' secure='false'/>]@T]" class="underlined">Domains By Proxy Private Registration product support page</a>.
<phrase key="FaqLine7Title" />
What are the benefits of Domains By Proxy Private Registration?
<phrase key="FaqLine7Text1" />
Private registration through Domains By Proxy gives you full control over your <strong>private domain names</strong> while providing the protection you need online. With Domains By Proxy, your personal identity is concealed, your privacy is maintained, domain-related spam is decreased, business endeavors are shielded, and domain name hijacking is prevented.
<phrase key="FaqLine7Text2" />
Domains By Proxy even creates a private and unique email address for each domain name. You get to decide if you want the email forwarded to you, filtered, or completely blocked. All of these benefits and more will ensure that both you and your domain name are safe and secure.
<phrase key="FaqLine7Text3" />

<phrase key="FaqLine8Title" />
Is my domain name eligible for Private Registration?
<phrase key="FaqLine8Text1" />
You can add private domain name registration to many domain name extensions, but some domain name registries do not allow private registration.
<phrase key="FaqLine8Text2" />
For more information, see <a target="_blank" data-ci="88041" href="[@T[link:<external linktype='communityurl' path='help/article/420' secure='false'/>]@T]" class="underlined">What is the difference between public and private domain name registration?</a>
<phrase key="FaqLine9Title" />
Why do I have a separate Domains By Proxy account?
<phrase key="FaqLine9Text1" />
Domains By Proxy is an affiliate company that is separate from your [@T[companyname:name]@T] account. Your Domains By Proxy account will further protect your private domain names and information. You cannot update, move, or transfer a domain name into a separate account if it has privacy. Therefore, domain hijackers would need to know your Domains By Proxy login information to cancel your private registration and steal your domain name. The additional layer of security that Domains By Proxy provides will give you a peace of mind you deserve.
<phrase key="FaqLine10Title" />
What can I do in my Domains By Proxy account?
<phrase key="FaqLine10Text1" />
When you log in to your Domains By Proxy account, updates are simple to make. Private domain registration gives you the perfect combination of security and accessibility, so you can spend less time worrying about your domain name and more time building and maintaining your website.
<phrase key="FaqLine10Text2" />
If you move, create a new email address, or get a new phone number, you can simply log in to your Domains By Proxy account and update your contact information with ease. As you manage your private registration, you can use the same contact information for all of your domain names, or you can individually update the contact information associated with each of them.
<phrase key="FaqLine10Text3" />
Domains By Proxy makes it easy to prove you&#39;re the rightful owner of your domain, while protecting your online identity. If a third party needs proof of registration for your private domain name for legal- or business-related reasons, simply request a Registrant Verification Letter and Domains By Proxy sends an official letter to a specified recipient confirming your domain name registration.
<phrase key="FaqLine11Title" />
How can I access my Domains By Proxy account?
<phrase key="FaqLine11Text1" />
Visit <a data-ci="88042" href="https://www.domainsbyproxy.com/" target="_blank" class="underlined">DomainsByProxy.com</a> and enter the Domains By Proxy Private Registration username and password that we send to you via email when you purchase private domain registration. If you don&#39;t have the email and you do not remember your login information, don&#39;t worry! You can retrieve the customer number, request a password hint, and reset the password on Domains By Proxy&#39;s website.

How much is privacy worth to you?
<phrase key="PrivateRegistrationText1" />
Did you know that anytime you register a domain, <strong>your personal information is exposed 24 hours a day</strong>? Your name. Your address. Your phone number. Your email. It&#39;s all published online for anyone to see, as <a class="isToolTip" data-toggle="tooltip" title="The Internet Corporation of Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) requires accredited registars to publish the registrant's contact information, as well as other details, in the WHOIS database, which is available to the public 24/7.">mandated by ICANN</a>. But you have the power to change this. With Private Registration&hellip;

<phrase key="ProtectedRegistrationTitle" />
Protect yourself from spam, scams, and prying eyes.
<phrase key="ProtectedRegistrationSubTitle1" />
Don&rsquo;t let this happen to you!
<phrase key="ProtectedRegistrationText1" />
Let&rsquo;s say your credit card expires and you forget to update your account with the new one. Or you change your email address. Or maybe you just forget to renew your domain. In the blink of an eye, a social engineer or someone close to you could transfer your domain name away without your permission.
<phrase key="ProtectedRegistrationText2" />
When the domain name goes, your website, email account – everything – goes with it!<sup>**</sup>
<phrase key="ProtectedRegistrationText3" />
But there is something you can do to protect yourself: Apply Protected Registration to your most important domain names.<sup>&#134;&#134;</sup> Should your registration expire for any reason, protected domains will be safe for up to 12 months. No one else can step in and steal them away from you.
<phrase key="ProtectedRegistrationSubTitle2" />
Protected Registration is packed with the safeguards and security you need:
<phrase key="ProtectedRegistrationItem1" />
<strong>Expiration Protection</strong> avoids loss of domain ownership due to credit card expiration, failed billing, outdated contact information – even simple forgetfulness!
<phrase key="ProtectedRegistrationItem2" />
<strong>Deadbolt Transfer Protection</strong> makes it impossible for MOST transfers to occur – whether inadvertent, accidental or malicious.
<phrase key="ProtectedRegistrationItem3" />
<strong>Ownership Protection</strong>–Our quarterly email updates help you keep an eye on your domain status.
<phrase key="ProtectedRegistrationText4" />
<strong>As a special bonus</strong>, Protected Registration includes both Private and Business Registration to keep your personal information hidden while publishing your business info in the WhoIs database!

Thanks to phishing, pharming, and a long list of other scams, Web visitors grow more wary by the day. But there is something you can do to reassure them you&#39;re one of the good guys: Put a Certified Domain validation seal on your website. <a class="popup-url" href="[@T[link:<external linktype="STARFIELDSEALURL" path="siteseal/verify" secure="false"><param name="ci" value="80777" /><param name="sealId" value="cb55dcfeb7e9372266d4979a298dc088fc092c034e6a8ca8ccce8457af486453" /></external>]@T]">View Sample Certification</a>.
<phrase key="CertifiedRegistrationItem1" />
To acquire Certified Domain accreditation, you must undergo a credentials check that confirms the contact information provided with your domain registration.
<phrase key="CertifiedRegistrationItem2" />
Once the credentials have been authenticated, [@T[companyname:name]@T] electronically issues a non-transferable Certified Domain seal that you can load to your website and WhoIs display. This process can generally be completed in 10 minutes, with the Certified Domain seal issued to your site within 1 business day.
<phrase key="CertifiedRegistrationItem3" />
The seal remains there until it expires or until a change in your domain contact information makes it necessary for you to reapply for accreditation.
<phrase key="CertifiedRegistrationText2" />

Domains By Proxy was launched in 2002 to address one of the biggest shortcomings of the Internet — loss of privacy. In fact, Domains By Proxy was the very first Internet WHOIS privacy service, and was created in direct response to consumer demand. Supported by a patented private registration process, Domains By Proxy believes that now, more than ever, you should be able to keep your personal contact information private when you register a domain name.
